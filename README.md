Flutter Travel App
Welcome to our Flutter travel application! This project aims to create a user-friendly travel application with three main functionalities: "My Trips", "Add Trips", and "View Visited Places".

Features
1. My Trips
In this section, users can view a list of all the trips they have saved. Each trip will display relevant information such as the trip name, date, location, and any additional details provided by the user.

2. Add Trips
Users can add new trips to their list by providing details such as pictures, descriptions, dates, and locations. This feature allows users to organize and plan their future trips conveniently within the application.

3. View Visited Places
Users can visualize the places they have already visited on maps. This feature provides an interactive way for users to reminisce about their past travels and explore their journey visually.
